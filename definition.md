# Sheet 13: Abbreviations, complex words and glossary

**Since all the recommendations in this sheet are often difficult to implement, they do not fall under the minimum level required by French law. These are AAA-level recommendations that allow access to information to certain users. In spite of this, they remain important and even essential recommendations for access to information for certain users.**

## Issues for users with disabilities

Abbreviations and complex words are an issue that primarily concern users with cognitive impairments, users who have a level of education below the 6th grade, or some deaf users who are more versed in the sign language than in the written language.

Using complex terms without defining them, without providing help to understand their meaning, using figurative expressions, and so on, create issues for these users and prevents them from understanding the texts and accessing the information.

## In practice

### Pronunciation of words

Some words can't be understood if the pronunciation is not known. Some users, who have cognitive impairments or use speech synthesis, need these pronunciations.

An example is "I can lead you to the lead mine". A speech synthesizer might read both "lead" words with the same pronunciation, which will be confusing for the user. This sentence is then difficult to understand.

The easiest way to make this pronunciation accessible to all is to indicate in square brackets, immediately after the word concerned, the pronunciation of the word: "I can lead you to the lead [led] mine".

### Abbreviations

Often the abbreviations or acronyms are understood only by a part of users in the know, or experts of the field concerned, or of an advanced level of education.

To enable comprehension by all, you must indicate their meaning on the first occurrence in a document.

The simplest way to do this is to indicate immediately after the abbreviation the meaning between parentheses. For example: VAT (value added tax).

### Jargons, unusual expressions, idioms, and words requiring advanced reading abilities

Each text that requires a more advanced reading level than 6<sup>th</sup> grade (excluding proper nouns and titles) should be explained:

- The text is illustrated through an image or graphic symbols adapted to the reading level corresponding to the first cycle of secondary education;
- The text is available in a sign language version;
- The text is available in spoken version;
- A suitable abstract is proposed, with a reading level adapted to 6<sup>th</sup> grade.

Similarly, jargon, idiomatic or unusual expressions should be explained:

- Through a definition in the adjacent context of the expression.
- Through a definition provided via a definition list.
- Through a definition available in the same page.
- The expression is contained in a link to the definition.

For plain language writing recommendations, we refer you to the **Easy-to-Read**  European standards. You can find [guidelines on the Easy-to-read website](http://easy-to-read.eu/european-standards/). These standards provide recommendations for writing and illustrating texts so that they are accessible to people with mental, psychological or cognitive disabilities.

### Glossary

For all these terms that require definitions, it is also possible to set up a glossary. Thus, instead of indicating the required alternatives directly in the text, you can link words to their definitions in the glossary. It is even possible to partly automate this mechanism.

Get closer to your IT department to assess this possibility.
