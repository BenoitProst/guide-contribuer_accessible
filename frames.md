# Sheet 3: Embed content from other sites on your pages

Frames allow to embed elements (portions of websites, videos, a whole web site) from other websites. They are generally used to integrate content from social networks, to insert videos in text content&hellip;

## The challenge for users with disabilities

Frames have content that you generally do not own (you can't change it), and you do not know its accessibility level either. Moreover, these frames can be complex, meaning they are very rich in content.

For a visually impaired user using a [screen reader](glossary.md #screen-reader), being warned of the type of content type in a frame gives the opportunity to choose whether to explore it or not. In addition, frames titles provide the user with an additional way to navigate the page, by jumping from frame to frame, being aware of their content without going into them.

The title of a frame must give an indication about the content and allow the user to make a choice. The title must summarize the contents of the frame. For example, for a video, you can indicate the title of this video: "Video of the 2017 Awards Ceremony".

## In practice and in pictures

The insertion of a frame necessarily involves the writing of computer code. Check with the developers of your site.

## Memo for Action

- Do I really need to embed external content?
- If embedded content is essential, is it accessible?
- Is there a way to put a title on this embedded third party content (ask the IT department)?
