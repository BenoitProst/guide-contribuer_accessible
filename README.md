# Authoring for the Web in an accessible way

## Presentation

This authoring guide is intended for anyone who is required to produce web content via a text editor provided by a Content Management Software (CMS). There is no need to be able to read or write HTML code to use this guide.

The guide will address the issues of inserting texts, images, multimedia content or embedded content from other websites.

For educational purposes, we will deliberately address here only the notions useful for Web content authors, without having to use an HTML editor.

Similarly, we will not discuss in this guide notions related to design or layout.

## How to use this guide

This guide has been designed as a series of practical fact sheets sharing the same presentation for easy use. You can read them according to your needs, without having to follow a particular order, each file being independent.

Each sheet has the same structure:

* Issues for users with disabilities
* In practice and in pictures
* Memo for action

In addition to these three sections, you can also find, in some sheets, these sections:

* Stereotypes
* See also
* See elsewhere

Finally, you will always find at the bottom of the sheet:

* Matching criteria in the RGAA 3
* Contents

## Categories

* Images
* Frames
* Colors
* Multimedia
* Tables
* Links
* Mandatory elements
* Information structure
* Presentation of information
* Consultation

This guide is written in markdown. You will find in this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) details about this language. Finally, it can also be [read online](https://github.com/DISIC/guide-contribuer_accessible/blob/english/0-intro.md).
