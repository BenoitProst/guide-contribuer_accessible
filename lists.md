# Sheet 8: Bulleted lists and numbered lists

## Issues for users with disabilities

Structuring content with the appropriate elements provides an improved browsing experience for [screen reader](glossary.md#screen-reader) users.

A user who is blind, visually impaired, or has reading difficulties, and uses a [screen reader](glossary.md#screen-reader) to browse the content of a page, will use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between the different types of elements. She can jump from headings to headings, go to the next form field, or go to the previous list.

In addition to allowing navigation between elements, this also allows her to bypass them.

In the case of a list, the number of items in the list is output by the screen reader, as well as the range of the item in the list. Thus, if the user thinks the list too long, she can simply bypass it rather than scanning it in its entirety, she can also go to the beginning of the list, or to the end directly.

## In practice and in pictures

To insert a list with a text editor, you must select the contents and click on the appropriate icon.

In most text editors, there are two buttons:

- a button to insert an unordered list, typically represented by this icon <img src="img/listes/icone-liste.png" alt="" />;
- a button to create an ordered list, usually represented by this icon <img src="img/listes/icone-liste2.png" alt="" />.

An ordered list is a numbered list. A numbered list is required when the order of items is essential, for example the steps of a process.

An unordered list applies in all other cases.

A list is generally recommended only for short lists of items. Think of a shopping list or a list of steps of a recipe for example.

Below is an example of bulleted list in CKEditor.

## Memo for Action

- Couldn't this succession of very short paragraphs be replaced by a list?
- When you start sentences with a hyphen, or a symbol, ask yourself if you are not creating a "fake" list.

## Stereotypes

- **"The formatting of my lists can't be changed": wrong!** All elements can have different styles. Structuring lists doesn't cause styling issues. Ask the person in charge of the design of your website for different styles for your lists.

- When the content of the list items is rather lengthy, it is preferable to use paragraphs with headings. See [sheet 7: Headings, or the page outline](titres.md)
