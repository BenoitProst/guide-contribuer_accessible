# Accessible Authoring for the Web

## Introduction

This guide for [authors](glossary.md#author) is provided as part of the complementary resources of the version 3 of the <span lang="fr">Référentiel Général d’Accessibilité pour les Administrations</span> (RGAA&nbsp;3 - General Framework for Accessibility for the French Administrations).


The RGAA 3 is composed of an [introduction document](https://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/introduction-RGAA.html), an [companion guide](https://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/rgaa-companion-guide.html) and a [technical reference](https://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/criteria.html). This set of documents have come into force since they were made official by the [Order of April 29, 2015 (in French)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030540064&dateTexte=20150921), itself specifying the [article 47 of law 2005-102 of February 11, 2005 (in French)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000809647&fastPos=1&fastReqId=1497340759&categorieLien=cid&oldAction=rechTexte) and [Order 2009-546 of May 14, 2009 (in French)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030540064&categorieLien=id).

Complementary resources have no regulatory value and are designed to help you make your digital content accessible and compliant with the RGAA&nbsp;3.

## Who is this guide for

This authoring guide is intended for anyone who is required to produce web content via a text editor provided by a Content Management System (CMS). There is no need to be able to read or write HTML code to use this guide.

The guide will address the issues of inserting texts, images, multimedia content or embedded content from other websites.

## Stick with your own trade

It is common for the same person to perform different functions, especially in small structures. However, the complexity of the Web tends to specialize certain functions and to distribute work on specific positions. This guide will only cover the web authoring, and will be supplemented by other guides addressing other aspects of the web production chain.

For educational purposes, we will deliberately address here only the notions useful for Web content authors, without having to use an HTML editor.

Similarly, we will not discuss in this guide notions related to design or layout.

Caution: most text editors allow you to insert HTML code to modify the appearance of the text. We warn you against the temptation to alter the code without prior training. Without technical knowledge, you are likely to cause errors that could have an impact on the consultation of contents by people with disabilities.

In addition, even if your intention was to compensate for code errors related to site design and software settings to make content more accessible, any code intervention by [authors](glossary.md#author) makes it difficult or even impossible to repair on the developers side afterwards.

## How to use this guide

This guide has been designed as a series of practical fact sheets sharing the same presentation for easy use. You can read them according to your needs, without having to follow a particular order, each file being independent.

Each sheet has the same structure:

* **Issues for users with disabilities**: this section clarifies the importance of the recommendations, for the users concerned
* **In practice and in pictures**: this is a mini-tutorial explaining step by step, with illustrations, what you need to do to take into account the accessibility, in relation with the topic covered in the sheet
* **Memo for Action**: A bullet-point list completes the tutorial, to help you remember the basics and put into practice the recommendations discussed earlier in the sheet.

In addition to these three sections, you can also find, in some sheets, these sections:

* **Stereotypes**: we dissect here the stereotypes regarding accessibility on the sheet topic;
* **See also**: here we indicate when there are links to other guides published as part of the complementary resources to the RGAA 3;
* **See elsewhere**: we list here a selection of third-party resources whose quality and complementarity to the approach adopted in this guide seem interesting.

Finally, you will always find at the bottom of the sheet:


* **Matching criteria in the RGAA 3**: criteria of the RGAA 3 Technical Reference related with the current topic;
* **Contents**: a list allowing you to browse through the guide.
